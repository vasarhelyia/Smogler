Location based air quality information, on your iPhone and your Apple Watch. 

## How do I get started? ##

The first step is to [acquire your own token for the WAQI API access](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/).

Look up the `token` constant in `APIService.swift` and replace the dummy string with your token.

The project has no external dependencies at the moment, so you should be fine building/running it. :+1:

### Where's the air quality data coming from? ###

From the [public API](https://aqicn.org/api/) of the [World Air Quality Index Project](https://waqi.info/) originating EPA.
